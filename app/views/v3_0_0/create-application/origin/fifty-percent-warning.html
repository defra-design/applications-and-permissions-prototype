        <p>For animals which have moved into a TB breakdown herd that are then removed as TB reactors or direct
            contacts before the herd regains officially TB free (OTF) status,
            a 50% reduction in compensation is applied to these animals.
        </p>

        <p>This does not apply if:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-body govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the destination herd is registered to a bovine Tb health scheme. Accreditation from the Cattle Health Certification Standards (CHECS) must be in place before the breakdown began</li>
            <li>the cattle are moving to any type of approved or licenced finishing unit, or to a TB isolation unit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For more information, read the slaughter and compensation section on the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-getting-your-cattle-tested-in-england#slaughter-and-compensation">GOV.UK Bovine TB guidance page</a> (opens in new tab).
