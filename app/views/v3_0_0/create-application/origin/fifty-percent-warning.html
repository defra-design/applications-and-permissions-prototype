        <p>If cattle are removed as reactors from a TB breakdown herd before they gain OTF
            (officially Tuberculosis free) status, you might receive 50% less compensation.
        </p>

        <p>This does not apply if:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-body govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the destination herd is registered to a bovine TB health scheme (before the breakdown began)</li>
            <li>the cattle are moving to any type of approved or licenced finishing unit, or to a TB isolation unit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For more information, read the slaughter and compensation section on the
