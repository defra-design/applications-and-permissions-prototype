        <p class="govuk-body">You can use this service to apply for a Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) movement licence.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Before animals move onto or off a farm or premises with TB restrictions,
        you must apply for a licence with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).</p>



        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if a licence has been sent to you before you apply</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to use this service to apply for a licence to move animals off a TB restricted farm to go to slaughter.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            You should have a general licence in the information pack sent to you from APHA.
            The pack was posted to you when your herd was placed under TB restriction.
            This licence allows you to move animals:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>from a TB restricted farm direct to slaughter</li>
            <li>via a slaughter gathering or red market (if the licence was issued after 30 September 2024)</li>
        </ul>



        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Movement types you can use this service for </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can use this service if you are moving animals from one of these origins:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>unrestricted market</li>
            <li>TB restricted farm</li>
            <li>premises with TB restrictions</li>
            <li>approved finishing units (AFU), including enhanced with grazing (AFUE)</li>
            <li>unrestricted farm or premises</li>
            <li>TB isolation unit</li>
            <li>location after the animals have been imported</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">And they are going to one of these destinations:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>slaughter or a red market</li>
            <li>dedicated sales for TB (orange markets)</li>
            <li>approved finishing units (AFU), including enhanced with grazing (AFUE)</li>
            <li>TB restricted farm</li>
            <li>premises with TB restrictions</li>
        </ul>



        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Moving animals onto a TB restricted farm</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">If your farm or premises is not under TB restrictions and animals
            are moving onto a TB restricted farm, the TB restricted farm needs to apply for a licence.
            We need details about their biosecurity practices to process the licence.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you need more information before you apply for a licence, see the
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-getting-your-cattle-tested-in-england" class="govuk-link">
                Bovine TB: get your cattle tested in England</a> guidance.
        </p>




        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">APHA cannot process or issue a licence if:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>reactors are still on your farm or premises</li>
            <li>animals are awaiting skin or blood test results</li>
            <li>TB testing is overdue</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Contact your vet if you are unsure whether the tests have been sent. If APHA has not received the tests, there could be delays in processing your licence.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Depending on the movement type, you may need:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the county parish holding (CPH) number and address where the animals are moving from</li>
            <li>where the animals are moving to, for example the type of market</li>
            <li>an email address to send the licence to</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If animals are moving onto your farm or premises, you need to enter information about your biosecurity practices that reduce the risk of spreading TB.
            You also need to upload a biosecurity map.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">It can take up to 5 working days to process your application. It may take longer if veterinary checks are needed, or if we need further information.</p>
